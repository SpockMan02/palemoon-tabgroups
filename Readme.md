# Tabgroups add-on

This is the repository for the Tabgroups add-on source code for Pale Moon, based on Tim Taubert's work as
part of the proposal to remove Tab groups from Firefox and moving the removed code to an extension.

Homepage for the extension: http://www.palemoon.org/tabgroups.shtml

Code is licensed under the MPL 2.0, and taken from the Mozilla/Firefox source tree with miscellaneous
fixups to make it work in Pale Moon and to provide some compatibility with other tab extensions.
